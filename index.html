            <p>
                We are here to make your snowmobile purchasing process easier. When it comes to big mountain and backcountry sledding, there are really two brands that stand out above the rest; SkiDoo and Polaris. Generally in our experience here at SledCompz, people tend to stick with the brand that they try first. However, there are certainly questions people have when purchasing. Such as, what is the difference? Which is better? Which better suits my needs? Which is cheaper? Who has better longevity? We intend to answer as many of these questions as we can. We do not want to make a decision for you or give you our opinions. We are here to compare facts to facts aboubt the different sled brands and let you come to your own conclusion. If this sounds helpful to you, then continue to explore our website to learn as much as you can in your purchasing process!
