        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Have you ever struggled with comparing different brands of snowmobiles? The struggle ends here with SledCompz. Here you will find detailed comparisons of the top brands of snowmobiles.</p>


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My audience is people who generally have experience snowmbiling but not so much that they have developed brand loyalty yet, as is very common in the sport. This will help people who have maybe done some riding but are relatively new and maybe looking to buy their first sleds.</p>

        <h3>Website Logo</h3>
        <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
        Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/fec934-000000-15616d-9ea3b0" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/fec934-000000-15616d-9ea3b0</a>


        <table class="colors">
            <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
            <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
            <tr><td class="primary">#FEC934</td><td class="secondary" style="color: white;">#000000</td><td class="accent1">#15616D</td><td class="accent2">#9EA3B0</td></tr>
        </table>

        <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Typography</h3>

        <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

        <h4>Heading Font: [Font Name here]  <!-- change this --></h4>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: [Font Name here]  <!-- change this --></h4>

        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
            When you come to SledCompz you will be able to see a new tool for comparing the two top competitors in the snowmobile world: SkiDoo (BRP) and Polaris. In the snowmobile world it is extremely common for there to be blood deep brand loyalty. This is generally established by either the first sled that someone rents and if not that, then the first one they buy. There are certainly exceptions but for the average sled owner, this is the case.  This site is for someone who has not established what brand they want to jump in with. This would likely be someone who has not bought a sled yet and wants to make an informed decision on what many consider to be the two top of the line brands in the market. Some of the activities one might want to complete would be to develop a customizable comparison where you can select the specific traits that you would like to compare. Along with that, they could save the comparisons they have made to a downloadable file to make it easier to send to others that may be involved in the purchasing process. The only information that someone would generally need is to know that they want to know which sled to buy and some semblance of an idea of what a sled is. Visitors will want to come here because there is not a great tool out there at the time to do this, the only way to gather the information is to snap back and forth between tabs in a browser and even then, the websites will be organized so differently that finding the separate information from both sides may create some difficulties and there will certainly be no way to save your comparisons without tediously writing them out yourself.

        <h3>SkiDoo Lineup</h3>
        <p>
            The SkiDoo Freeride colors available are the Flare Yellow and Black scheme and the Timeless Black. You can also get it with sea-level or high-altitude calibration. After that you have the choice between the 850 E-TEC engine and the 850 E-TEC Turbo R. You can also choose between the normal 4.5” display or a 10.25” color touchscreen. The touchscreen is also integrated with BRP connect. The ski stance stands at 36” from factory and is adjustable. When it comes to starters you have the choice of the E-TEC SHOT Starter or the Electric Starter. The track length options are 146”, 154”, and 165”. When it comes to track profile, or lug size, you have the option of 3” lugs or 2.5” lugs. If you choose a track length of 165” you must have the 3” lugs. If you opt for the 154” track length, you can choose either option. With the selection of the 146” track though you can only have the 2.5” lugs. I won’t go into details on the accessories other than what is included with the Freeride. There are seven accessories that come with it: the adjustable brake lever, performance small diameter handlebar, deep snow low grab handle, handlebar extension kit(120mm), T-motion delete arm, sway bar quick-disconnect link kit, and rail ice scratchers.

	        The SkiDoo Summit X is available in three colors, Timeless Black, Dusty Navy and Black, and Monument Grey and Black. You can choose between sea-level and high-altitude calibration. You can also choose between the 850 E-TEC and the 850 E-TEC Turbo R. You can also choose between the 4.5” digital display and the 10.25” Color Touchscreen with BRP connect. The ski stance stands at 34” from factory and is adjustable. The starters available on the Summit are the E-TEC SHOT Starter, Electric Starter, and Manual Starter. The available track lengths are 154” and 165”. The available track profiles or lug sizes are 3” lugs or 2.5” lugs. You can get either 2.5” or 3” lugs on both track lengths, however if you choose to go with 3” lugs, you do have to switch to at least the E-TEC SHOT Starter. The Summit X comes with seven accessories: adjustable brake lever, performance small diameter handlebar, deep snow low grab handle, 120mm handlebar extension kit, deep snow lightweight ski spindle kit, tMotion adjustable limiter strap, and rail ice scratchers.
